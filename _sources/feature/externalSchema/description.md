## Feature Type based on a published schema

This example shows how an existing schema can be used to define a payload for a container model such as the OGC API Features feature schema.

This particular example uses a schema defined in another message-oriented environment, and **highlights an existing practice of using JSON-LD contexts defined for components.**

The OGC Building Blocks uses the same approach, with the added capabilities around example validation and mechanisms composition into other structures with transparent dependencies.
